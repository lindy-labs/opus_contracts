Guidelines on how to effectively contribute to the project.

## Contributing

### Pull requests and code reviews

Most contributions should happen via a pull request. Unless it's a trivial change,
opening a PR is always preferable - besides the obvious benefits, it is a
chance for all involved parties to learn something.

When creating a PR, please include at least a short description of the change
and the context (i.e. what, why, how), so it's easier for a reviewer to pick
up. If you want to get feedback on specific areas, point it out in the
description as well.

Repo maintainers should prioritize reviewing pull requests over their "normal"
tasks to unblock other teammates and help push the project forward.

### Conventional commits

Commit messages should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines.
