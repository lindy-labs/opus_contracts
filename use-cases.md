# Use Cases

A stable peg is cool, but a stablecoin is only as useful as what it enables its holders to do. Even though there are novel use cases coming to Opus, here’s what you can do TODAY:

* **<1.0x exposure to any token**

Simply open a credit line against your portfolio and swap CASH for any token using [AVNU](https://www.avnu.fi/).

* **Leveraged exposure to any supported token**

By borrowing against your portfolio it is possible to construct a multicall that adds collateral, flash mints CASH, swaps it for an Opus supported token like STRK, and adds it as collateral. Your maximum leveraged is limited by the LTV threshold of your trove—and as you know, these are unique to you. You can calculate it with the formula:

$$
\text{Maximum Leverage Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{LTV Threshold}}
$$

* **Offramp to cover real life expenses**

Opus’ deep USDC liquidity allows for low slippage swaps between CASH and USDC. As a centralized stablecoin, USDC can be easily offramped via Circle, Coinbase, Kraken, and other renowned exchanges.

As demand for CASH grows, the DAO can move to establish direct CASH↔USD ramps to minimize existing friction and potential slippage.
