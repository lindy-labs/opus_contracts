# Overview

Opus is a cross margin autonomous credit protocol that lets you borrow against your portfolio of carefully curated, sometimes yield-bearing, collateral. With minimal human intervention, the interest rates, maximum loan-to-value ratios and liquidation thresholds are dynamically determined by each user's collateral profile.
