# Monitoring collateral

A collateral that has been onboarded as a `yang` needs to be regularly monitored to ensure that its risk assessment is updated.

If a collateral subsequently fails to comply with the requirements set out in the onboarding process, it may be suspended, and consequently delisted.

* If a collateral type fails to satisfy any of the requirements, an assessment should be made to determine if it is capable of being rectified at short notice. If this is not possible, or it was not rectified within a reasonable amount of time, the `yang` should be suspended immediately.
* If a suspended collateral type subsequently satisfies all of the requirements again within the stipulated time period set out in the Shrine smart contract, then it may be unsuspended. Otherwise, the `yang` will be permanently delisted as set out in the Shrine smart contract.
