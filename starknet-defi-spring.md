# Starknet DeFi Spring

## Introduction

Starting from 17 October 2024, users who borrow CASH will receive STRK rewards as part of the [Starknet DeFi Spring](https://www.starknet.io/blog/defi-spring-2-0/) initiative by the Starknet Foundation.

## Methodology

The Starknet Foundation determines the amount of incentives on a daily basis in their discretion.

Users who borrow CASH will earn a share of each day's incentives as a proportion of the total CASH borrowed across all Troves for the day. The amount of CASH borrowed will be aggregated for each address i.e. if one address opens two Troves, the amount of CASH borrowed will be summed up for that address. These will be calculated based on a snapshot taken at the end of each day.\
\
For example, if User A is borrowing 100 CASH across all of his Troves on a given day, there is a total debt of 1000 CASH for that day, and the incentives are 500 STRK for that day, then User A will be entitled to `(100 / 1000) * 500 = 50` STRK for that day.

For the avoidance of doubt, the [protocol seeded TVL](technical-documentation/smart-contracts/transmuter-module.md) has been excluded from this initiative.

## Participation

Users will automatically be part of this initiative if they are actively borrowing CASH. No further action is required.

## Claiming

The claim page will be updated soon.&#x20;
